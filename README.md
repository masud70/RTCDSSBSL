## Key Features

### Employee Database Management
The system enables administrators to maintain a centralize employee database. It allows for the addition, updating, and deletion of employee records, making it easy to store and retrieve essential employee information such as personal details, contact information, and job positions.

### Training Management and Notifications
The system includes functionality to manage employee training programs. Administrators can add and update training information, including upcoming sessions and topics. The system also supports sending SMS notifications to employees about upcoming training events, ensuring timely communication and participation.

### Employee Data Printing
With the employee data printing feature, administrators can generate printable reports or documents containing relevant employee information. This functionality facilitates record-keeping and provides a tangible resource for various administrative tasks, such as performance evaluations or compliance audits.

### Real-time Office Updates and Communication
The system includes a dedicated timeline section where authorized users, such as administrators or managers, can post office updates, news, or announcements. Employees can view these updates in real-time and engage with the content by reacting and leaving comments, promoting transparent communication and fostering a sense of community within the organization.
